# Subgraph Deployment and Client Usage

This guide details the steps required to deploy the provided subgraph to Goldsky and run the accompanying subgraph client application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

1.  **Node.js and npm:** The subgraph development and client rely on Node.js. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included, or you can install yarn ([yarnpkg.com](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)). **Ensure you have Node.js version 20.18.1 or higher.**
2.  **Goldsky Account:** You need an account on Goldsky to host your subgraph. Sign up at [goldsky.com](https://goldsky.com/).
3.  **Goldsky CLI:** This tool allows you to deploy subgraphs to the Goldsky platform. Follow the installation instructions in the [Goldsky Documentation](https://docs.goldsky.com/introduction).

## Subgraphs

### Deploying the Subgraph to Goldsky

Follow these steps to build and deploy the subgraph:

1.  **Navigate to Subgraph Directory:**
    Open your terminal and change to the directory of this README:

    ```bash
    cd subgraph
    ```

    **IMPORTANT: you must run all npm commands inside the `subgraph` directory.**

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary node modules:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Authenticate with Goldsky:**
    Log in to your Goldsky account using the CLI. Go to settings section of your Goldsky dashboard to get your API key.

    ```bash
    goldsky login
    ```

4.  **Select network:**

    ```bash
    npm run select-calibnet
    npm run select-mainnet
    ```

5.  **Generate Code:**
    The Graph CLI uses the `subgraph.yaml` manifest and GraphQL schema (`schema.graphql`) to generate AssemblyScript types.

    ```bash
    npm run codegen
    ```

6.  **Build the Subgraph:**
    Compile your subgraph code into WebAssembly (WASM).

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

7.  **Deploy to Goldsky:**
    Use the Goldsky CLI to deploy your built subgraph.

    ```bash
    goldsky subgraph deploy <your-subgraph-name>/<version>
    ```

    - Replace `<your-subgraph-name>` with the desired name for your subgraph deployment on Goldsky (e.g., `my-pdp-explorer`). You can create/manage this name in your Goldsky dashboard.
    - Replace `<version>` with a version identifier (e.g., `v0.0.1`).
    - You can manage your deployments and find your subgraph details in the [Goldsky Dashboard](https://app.goldsky.com/). The deployment command will output the GraphQL endpoint URL for your subgraph upon successful completion. **Copy this URL**, as you will need it for the client.

8.  **Tag the Subgraph (Optional):**
    Tag the subgraph you deployed in step 6.

    ```bash
    goldsky subgraph tag create <your-subgraph-name>/<version> --tag <tag-name>
    ```

    - Replace `<tag-name>` with a tag name (e.g., `mainnet`).

    Remove the tag when you want to deploy a new version of the subgraph.

    ```bash
    goldsky subgraph tag delete <your-subgraph-name>/<version> --tag <tag-name>
    ```

### Modifying and Redeploying the Subgraph

If you need to make changes to the subgraph's logic, schema, or configuration, follow these general steps:

1.  **Modify Code:** Edit the relevant files:
    - `schema.graphql`: To change the data structure and entities being stored.
    - `subgraph-{calibnet|mainnet}.yaml`: To update contract addresses, ABIs, start blocks, or event handlers.
    - `src/*.ts`: To alter the logic that processes blockchain events and maps them to the defined schema entities.

2.  **Select network:**

    ```bash
    npm run select-calibnet
    npm run select-mainnet
    ```

3.  **Regenerate Code:** After modifying the schema or manifest, always regenerate the AssemblyScript types:

    ```bash
    graph codegen
    ```

4.  **Rebuild:** Compile the updated subgraph code:

    ```bash
    graph build
    ```

5.  **Redeploy:** Deploy the new version to Goldsky. It's good practice to increment the version number:
    ```bash
    goldsky subgraph deploy <your-subgraph-name>/<new-version>
    ```
    Replace `<new-version>` (e.g., `v0.0.2`).

**Development Resources:**

- **AssemblyScript:** Subgraph mappings are written in AssemblyScript, a subset of TypeScript that compiles to Wasm. Learn more at [https://www.assemblyscript.org/](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).
- **The Graph Documentation:** The official documentation covers subgraph development in detail: [https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/creating/starting-your-subgraph/](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/creating/starting-your-subgraph/).

## Goldsky Pipelines

### Create or update

```shell
goldsky pipeline apply pipelines/alpha-calibnet.yaml
goldsky pipeline apply pipelines/alpha-mainnet.yaml
```
